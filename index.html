            <p>
                <strong>John Doe:</strong> The Evolv is a case that is hard to beat at its price point. So far, I have owned this case for 4 months and I am very happy with it. I’m still impress with its built quality and how well it’s designed. Well
                enough to make me want to add stuff to make it look even better. Everything is easy to take off and put back on from filter, side door, PCI-E cover, top fan/radiator, and straps/cutout for cable management. Doing a build on it was easy,
                fast, and fun. The fan it came with is actually pretty good, nice and quiet. I got the black even though I wanted the silver, the black actually looks a whole lot better than I expected. The minor cons I listed up there are things I’m
                thinking up to make a perfect case even better. The whole making it taller and longer is for full custom water cooling. It has the ability for water cooling, but for those who want to cool both graphic card and CPU might want more space
                for larger/thicker radiator and dual radiator. If someone puts both radiator, spacing seems to be cramp and in most situation will have to remove hard drive bottom cage. I think the evolv atx is to fill in the space of what they are missing
                since they have cases for mini and too many full size to make it bigger. I can also confirm it’s on the heavier side, but to most it doesn’t matter because the case sits in one place anyways as what a desktop should be doing. Again, AWESOME
                case, totally satisfied with purchase. Know what you are getting and you’ll be happy.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Jane Someperson:</strong> The build looks amazing as this case is amazing. Just need good planing if going to make a custom loop in it. Would buy again!!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mary Smith:</strong> Modern ATX motherboards have 3 or more 4-pin fan headers and I prefer to use those so I can monitor each fan individually. This allows me to spin the intake fans at a higher rpm than the exhaust fans ensuring
                more positive pressure which ultimately keeps in the inside dust free. I think the company would be better off selling the case w/o fans and letting the consumer purchase the fans they want. I would imagine someone spending this kind of
                money on a case knows their cooling needs better than Phanteks. The front panel IO ports support USB 3.0, but with the new USB type C and thunderbolt looming, I hope they offer a way to replace the front panel to support motherboards with
                those capabilities.
